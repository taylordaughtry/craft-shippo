# Shippo Live Rates

This plugin adds Live Rates pulled from Shippo; completely integrated into the
Commerce checkout process.

## Feature Roadmap
- Pass product dimensions & weight to Shippo
- Allow users to customize their 'From Address' in the CMS.
- Account for Shippo's future [depreciation of synchronized rates](https://goshippo.com/docs/async).
